**Question:** {question}

**Assistant's Answer:** {answer}

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Helpfulness: Does the answer address the question fully?
2. Accuracy: Is the information correct?
3. Clarity: Is the answer well-organized and easy to understand?
4. Depth: Does it provide sufficient detail?

**Your Task:**
Rate the answer on a scale of 1-10, where:
- 1-3: Poor (incorrect, unhelpful, or confusing)
- 4-6: Average (partially helpful, some issues)
- 7-8: Good (helpful, accurate, clear)
- 9-10: Excellent (exceptional quality, comprehensive)

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{{"score": <number>, "explanation": "<brief explanation>"}}
